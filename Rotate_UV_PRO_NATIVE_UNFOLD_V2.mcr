/*
    Rotate UV - macro registration only.

    Drop this .mcr in <user macros> and the button appears under
    Customize -> Customize User Interface -> Category "TEST".

    This file deliberately contains NOTHING but the macroScript. The previous
    release shipped a .mcr that was a byte-for-byte copy of the .ms, including a
    development auto-open block, so the tool dialog opened by itself whenever Max
    evaluated the macros folder.

    Requirements:
      - Rotate_UV_PRO_NATIVE_UNFOLD_V2.ms on the script path (or run it once).
      - RotateUV_AutoSeam.exe beside the .ms or in <scripts>\RotateUVAtlas\.
      - 3ds Max 2022.2+ for native Unfold3D; 2026/2027 are the target versions.
